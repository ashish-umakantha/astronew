Web assignment:

I have done web assignment following two approaches,
* I have used both ui and api approach.
* getFlipkartPrices and getShopcluesPrices methods follow ui approach i.e get all the elements from ui and logic is written based on ui. The above methods get prices from Flipkart and Shopclues.
* getPaytmPrices method follow the api approach, i have used rest assured lib, got the end point from inspect and from response the logic is derived.
* Then i have combined all three methods, then sorted and showing the output on console.

I have attached the screen shot of the output as well.


Mobile assignment:

I have made the script more robust and made more full proof with assertions.
* I have used soft assert for asserting p1/p2 ui elements such as ui of onboarding screens.
* My scripts covers both functional and ui cases.
* I have used hard asserts for core functionality such as login, counting synopsis.
